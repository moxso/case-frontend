# Moxso Test

In this test, you have to implement the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to create a page that resembles [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news). However, you are encouraged to apply your own design and style. The final product does not need to strictly adhere to the look and feel of Hacker News.

## Tasks

1. Utilize the `topstories` endpoint to display 10 random stories. For each story, include the following details:
   - Title
   - Author name
   - Date of publication
   - Number of comments
   - Score
2. Arrange the posts in descending order based on their scores.
